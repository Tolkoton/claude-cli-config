"""Which files are the engine's own install, untouched — so that nobody's turn is judged by them.

`engine.py install` writes the engine into a project and never commits. Until the owner's first
commit every one of those files is untracked, and a check that reads "not in HEAD" as "written by
this turn" blames the session for the engine's own hooks, the seeded project.env and the guarded
files it never touched (board 786). `.claude/engine-lock.json` says what was installed: the git
blob id of every engine file (`files`) and of every seeded file as it was seeded (`seeds`).

    as_installed(root, files, ref=None, index=False) -> set[str]

names the files that are BOTH
  * absent from the base the caller compares with (`ref`, default HEAD; a repository with no
    commit has no base at all), and
  * byte-identical to what the lock recorded (the working file, or with `index` the staged one;
    a CRLF checkout matches its LF form, as engine.py reads it).

Both, never one. A file the base already has is the project's from then on: putting a tracked
project.env back to its seed is a change like any other, and the lock excuses nothing there.
A file that differs from the lock by one byte is somebody's edit. No lock, an unreadable lock,
a lock that does not name the file: nothing is taken on trust, and the caller judges as before.

The limit: the lock is a file of the project, under `.claude/`, which Claude Code protects from
an agent's write tools; a session that rewrites it on purpose through a script is the documented
boundary (docs/engine-limits.md, "The risk line"), not what this guards against.
