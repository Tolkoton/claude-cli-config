"""PreToolUse hook for Bash. Turns an ask-gated command into a PARK when
nobody is in the loop, and decides every push by environment.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
settings.json's `permissions.ask` list is correct policy: a publish, a
dependency change, a `gh` state change genuinely needs a human, because it
spends money or changes shared state. But its MECHANISM is an interactive
permission prompt. Unattended that prompt is answered by nobody, so the whole
run hangs on one command instead of parking one item and continuing.

PreToolUse runs BEFORE permission evaluation, so denying here preempts the
prompt and hands the reason back to the agent, which parks the item and moves
on. Attended, this hook does nothing for those commands and the normal prompt
fires as designed.

THIS DOES NOT WEAKEN THE ASK LIST. The command still does not run. The
difference is that the agent gets a reason it can act on instead of a dialog
nobody will close.

PUSH, BY ENVIRONMENT (board 603, owner decision)
------------------------------------------------
`git push` is no longer on the ask list of the settings file: a rule there
prompts in every environment, and no hook can lift it (a hook's "allow" does
not override an ask rule), so a cloud session stopped on every push of its own
branch. The rule lives here now, and the push is found anywhere in the
command — after a separator, behind `git -C <dir>`, inside `bash -c`, `sh -c`
or `eval`:

  environment                                      | decision
  -------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------
  unattended (the board runner; the mode file or   | deny: the runner sends the
  CLAUDE_UNATTENDED_SESSION=1)                     | branch itself
  cloud (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true) with             | allow for `git push [-u] origin
  CLOUD_COMMIT_POLICY="session-branch"             | <the checked-out claude/ branch>`
                                                   | (or HEAD) as the whole command;
                                                   | none for it inside a longer one
                                                   | (an allow approves the whole
                                                   | call); deny, with the reason, for
                                                   | any other push
  local with the owner, or a cloud session with    | ask: the owner confirms, as the
  the switch off                                   | ask rule made them before

A forced push, the deletion of a remote branch and a push into main or stable
are refused by block-dangerous.sh in every environment, whatever this hook
says; in the cloud this hook refuses them too, being no allowed form.

WHY PYTHON AND NOT BASH
-----------------------
`jq` is NOT installed on every machine that runs this template — verified
absent on the authoring machine 2026-08-27. Every hook that parses its stdin
with `jq` degrades to a silent no-op there, because the idiom in use is
`jq ... 2>/dev/null || echo ""` followed by an empty-value early exit. A
security hook that silently does nothing is worse than no hook, so this one
uses the standard library only. See .claude/references/hooks.md.

Exit codes: 0 with JSON on stdout = decision; 0 with no stdout = allow.
