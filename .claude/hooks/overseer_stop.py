"""Stop hook: auto-trigger an overseer 12-check audit on unit completion.

Redesign of the abandoned bash `overseer-on-stop.sh`. The bash hook reconstructed
the last assistant message by parsing the transcript JSONL named in the Stop
envelope — but the transcript is flushed asynchronously, so the hook raced the
writer and read a stale or empty turn (anthropics/claude-code#15813).

Claude Code now ships the finished turn's text directly on the Stop envelope as
`last_assistant_message` (field probe PASS, 2026-05-22 — see
.engine/artifacts/spikes/auto-overseer-redesign-2026-05-22.md). This hook reads that
field for the *completion text* and consults the transcript only for the
*structural tool-use signal*, which is a stable historical record by the time
Stop fires.

TRIGGER — both signals required:
  1. text sentinel: `=== UNIT N COMPLETE ===` on its own line in the message.
  2. tool signal:   in the current turn, an Edit/Write/MultiEdit on a code
                    path (configured via SOURCE_DIRS / CODE_EXTENSIONS in
                    .claude/project.env) AND a Bash verification command
                    (configured via CHECK_CMDS, or built-in broad default).

RECURSION GUARDS — per-branch, by design:
  - Audit request    — `.claude/state/overseer/.last_audit_sha`, the SHA of the last message whose
                       claim was answered; the same message does not claim twice.
  - Typed markers    — `.claude/state/overseer/.last_continue_sha`, the SHA of the last message
                       that was told its typed `OVERSEER_PASS` / `OVERSEER_REQUEST` means nothing.
  - Halt markers (BLOCK / ESCALATE / ADR_REQUIRED / SLICE_AWAITING_OWNER /
    SLICE_COMPLETE) silent-pass — owner takes over.

  `stop_hook_active` is deliberately not a guard: every hook-initiated turn arrives with it set,
  so it would make the request and the "continue" unreachable in the autonomous loop.

PHASE GUARD: `.claude/state/overseer/state` containing `plan` suppresses the audit — the
developer is designing, not completing units of work.

WHO AUDITS (board 015 / 018 / 033). Never the builder: on the trigger above this hook writes a
request package and tells the builder to launch the agent `overseer` (fresh context, no editing
tool) with the prompt `OVERSEER_REQUEST <id>`. The verdict is recorded by `overseer_verdict.py
record` from the agent's own answer; this hook continues, hands back a BLOCK or routes an ADR /
escalation only on that record. `OVERSEER_PASS` typed by the builder is refused. That script works
through two handlers in the project's settings, which `engine.py install` / `update` put there.
A project whose settings lack them cannot be audited at all — there is no second protocol — so a
claim there is answered with NOT_WIRED_REASON: say so, park the unit, never audit yourself.

Output: `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` on stdout (exit 0) injects the audit
request and continues the turn; empty stdout (exit 0) passes the turn through.

Invoked by Claude Code as `python3 .claude/hooks/overseer_stop.py` (see
.claude/settings.json Stop hooks). The `uv run` shebang only applies when the
file is executed directly; either way it needs no third-party dependency.
