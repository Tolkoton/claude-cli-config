"""The exact versions of the outside tools whose answer decides a check of the engine (board 107).

On 2026-10-09 ruff 0.17.0 came out at 19:46 UTC; within the hour uvx, asked for ruff with no version
and so taking the latest release, turned tests/test_engine_lint.py red on the server with no change
to the code, while the cloud judged the same commit green with 0.16.8. A check whose verdict moves
with the release calendar is not a check. So every call of such a tool takes its version from VERSIONS below — the
one place they are written — and raising a version is a task of its own.

How a tool is found (`command`):
  1. a tool on PATH whose `--version` names the pinned version — no fetch, works offline;
  2. `uvx <tool>@<version>` — uv fetches exactly that release into its cache;
  3. neither: None and the reason. The check does not judge in silence with another version: the
     caller fails with that reason, or (a signal, a formatter) says it did not run.
A project that pins a tool itself keeps its own version: `project_tool` finds it in the project's
virtual environment, and gate.py runs `uv run` / `poetry run` for a project with a lockfile and
the project's LINT_CMD / TYPECHECK_CMD / FORMAT_CMD as written (docs/engine-limits.md).

pytest is pinned here only for the engine's own measurements (evals, the simplifier's sets): in a
project it runs the project's code and so belongs to the project's environment, never to uvx.

    python3 .claude/hooks/tool_versions.py              # every tool, its version, how it would run here
    python3 .claude/hooks/tool_versions.py ruff         # the argv prefix for one tool, or why not (exit 1)

Standard library only.
