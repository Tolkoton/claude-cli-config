THE QUEUE. `.engine/lesson-queue.md`, one line per candidate:
    - <date UTC> | <source> | <slice> | <essence> #<id>
source is one of gate, overseer, parked, escalation, agent, simplifier, analyst (what the business analyst
should have asked and the owner had to correct). A candidate is added once: the id is a
hash of source + the normalised essence, and every id ever seen is kept in machine state
(`.claude/state/lessons/seen.json`), so a candidate that was triaged and removed does not come back
when its source is scanned again. No model is involved in collecting.

THE COLLECTORS (`collect`, called by the Stop gate and the overseer hook): the blocking findings of
`.claude/state/gate/last-report.json`, the PARKED entries of `.engine/overseer/parked.md` and the
open items of the task board (the tasks that carry `Відкритий пункт:`, board 037), the
non-AUTONOMOUS entries of `.engine/overseer/escalations.md`; the overseer hook adds an
`OVERSEER_BLOCK:` verdict itself (`add_from_verdict`). The agent adds a line when it finds a
non-obvious cause (the rule is in the self-learning-orchestrator skill, not in the persistent context).

THE REVIEW. After an overseer verdict of PASS, `review_request()` is appended to the hook's
"continue" text when the queue is not empty: file each candidate with `resolve` — into the project
memory (`.engine/overseer/MEMORY.md`, which demands two ledger citations), a rule proposal
(`.engine/rule-proposals.md`), feedback for the engine (`.engine/engine-feedback.md`) or discard it.
A resolved candidate leaves the queue.

NEVER INTO THE PERSISTENT CONTEXT AUTOMATICALLY — A LESSON BECOMES A RULE ONLY ON THE OWNER'S WORD
(board 040). Nothing here writes CLAUDE.md or `.claude/`. A rule proposal is put to the owner as a
task in `tasks/blocked/` (board.py `rule_question`): the question «Зробити це правилом?», the exact
text of the rule, and the offer `Дія виконавця: promote-rule <sha256 of the id and that text>`.
The overseer may add a recommendation (`--recommend`); it decides nothing, and no ledger entry
opens the way. `promote` needs the owner's «так» under that very offer, refuses inside a Claude
Code session (the board runner takes the action, through owner_action.py, after it has checked
that the answer arrived from the owner), and refuses when the persistent context would pass 200
lines. The rule lands in `.engine/rules.md`, which CLAUDE.md imports. A project without a task
board has one way: the owner's own terminal, `promote ID --owner-approved`.

STUCK. The same failure three times in a row (the key is the failure's normalised fingerprint) makes
`stuck` answer with the stuck protocol as additionalContext; a success resets the counter. It never
blocks. The Stop gate and the post-write lint feed the same counter (`note_failure` / `note_success`).

Standard library only; Python 3.11+. Hooks never fail the session: every hook entry exits 0.
