"""The guard of the guarded files after the fact (board 724, the design of board 717).

    python3 .claude/hooks/protected_guard.py session-start        # env-check.sh: the SessionStart envelope on stdin
    python3 .claude/hooks/protected_guard.py before               # board-runner.sh, before an agent's session: prints its snapshot
    python3 .claude/hooks/protected_guard.py after  < snapshot    # …and after it: exit 3 = put back, 4 = could NOT be put back
    python3 .claude/hooks/protected_guard.py pending < snapshot   # guarded files a commit of the session changed
    python3 .claude/hooks/protected_guard.py accept [<event>]     # the OWNER's command, in their own terminal

WHY. protect-paths.sh and block-dangerous.sh refuse a write to a guarded file by the text of the
tool call; a path kept in a variable, or a script the command starts, is not seen (board 714). So
the same files are looked at again when the write can no longer hide: at the end of the turn
(gate.py, layer stop), in the commit script (commit_checkpoint.sh) and by the board runner around
every session. The files are the GUARDED_PATTERNS of protected-path-list.sh — the constitution,
the settings, `.engine/rules.md`, migrations, CI workflows — among what git tracks or does not
ignore, plus the four named below wherever they exist. Secrets are not here: they are not in git
and reading leaves no trace.

THE SNAPSHOT, NOT HEAD. A snapshot holds, for every guarded file, its sha256 AND its content, so
a file can be put back whatever HEAD became. A session's snapshot is the file
`.claude/state/gate/protected/<session>.json`: taken when the session starts, resumes or is
cleared (never after a compaction: that would accept what the agent did before it) and after
every turn the gate passed. HEAD would be wrong twice: it does not see a change the agent
committed in the same turn, and it calls the owner's uncommitted edit, made before the turn, a
change of the turn.

WHAT THE GATE DOES (the owner's answer, board 717 question 3). On a difference it puts the file
back itself, at once — changed: the content of the snapshot; deleted: restored; new: removed —
keeps the discarded change as a patch (`discarded/<event>.patch`; the event's `.json` carries the
discarded content), writes the anomaly journal and blocks the turn once so that the agent reads
what was discarded. The agent has no command to run. Without a snapshot of the session (it began
before this guard, or SessionStart did not run), and when the gate is run by hand, the comparison
is with HEAD and nothing is put back: the gate cannot tell the agent's change from the owner's.

THE RUNNER'S SNAPSHOT IS NOT A FILE, AND ITS CHECK FAILS CLOSED. `.claude/state/` can be rewritten
by a shell command of the session, so a snapshot kept there deceives whoever reads it back (a
known limit for the gate). `before` therefore writes nothing: it PRINTS the snapshot, content
included; board-runner.sh holds it in its own process and hands it to `after` and `pending` on
stdin. `after` compares and puts back from that alone. Only the record of what was discarded is
written to the state directory, after the files are back, and a state directory that cannot be
written sends the record to a temporary directory instead of stopping the restore. Anything
`after` cannot do — a file it cannot put back, an error of its own — is exit 4 or another
non-zero code, and the runner stops the board on every code but 0 and 3. What this still rests
on: the runner's own programs (this file, board-runner.sh) as they were when the runner started.

THE OWNER'S OWN EDIT made while a turn runs is not told from the agent's: it is discarded the same
way and never lost. `accept` in the owner's terminal takes the files as they are now as the new
snapshot of every session; `accept <event>` first puts the discarded change of that event back.
Refused inside a Claude Code session (CLAUDECODE), as every owner's command is.
