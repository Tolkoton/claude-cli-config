# The one list of protected paths. Sourced, never run: protect-paths.sh (Edit|Write|MultiEdit)
# and block-dangerous.sh (Bash) both read it, so a path protected from one tool is protected
# from the other. Until board 714 the list lived in protect-paths.sh alone and the Bash hook
# did not know it: `printf x > .claude/constitution.md` and `cat .env` reached the shell.
#
# Each entry is an extended regular expression matched against one path: the file an edit tool
# names, or one word of a shell command. A hook that cannot find this file refuses the call.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Narrow allowlist, checked BEFORE the deny patterns.
#
# `\.env$` below is a secrets heuristic: it cannot tell a config file from a
# credentials file by name. That is the right default and it stays. But this
# template ships .claude/project.env as a COMMITTED, secret-free config file
# and docs/TEMPLATE-SETUP.md Step 2 instructs the operator to edit it — so the
# heuristic was blocking the setup path of the very template it protects.
#
# Scoped as tightly as possible: this exact filename, only directly inside a
# .claude/ directory. Any other *.env, including .claude/anything-else.env and
# project.env outside .claude/, is still denied.
#
# Rejected alternative: renaming to project.sh. It reads better, but every
# project already built from this template has a project.env that three hooks
# read by name, and a rename would silently stop those hooks configuring
# themselves. Silent breakage of downstream projects costs more than one
# audited exception here. If a secret is ever put in this file, that is a
# review failure, not a hook failure — the file is committed and visible.
